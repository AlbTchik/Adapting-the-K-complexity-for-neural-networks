# Adapting-the-K-complexity-for-neural-networks
I have come to the conclusion that Kolmogorov complexity is not well adapted to neural networks. Based on this conclusion, it is necessary to find an adaptation of the K-complexity for neural networks. To further our research, we will try to find a computable approximation.
